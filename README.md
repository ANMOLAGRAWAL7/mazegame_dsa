# Maze Solver

This project is a maze solver implemented in JavaScript. It provides three different algorithms to find the solution to a maze: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search.

## Features

- Solves mazes using Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search algorithms.
- Visualization of the maze solving process.
- Supports mazes with different start and end points.
- Displays the time taken by each algorithm to solve the maze.
